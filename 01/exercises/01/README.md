### Exercise 1.1-1

Give a real-world example that requires sorting or a real-world example that
requires computing a convex hull.

### Solution

Cash sorting machines, using a "magic wand" selection tool in a photo editor.

### Exercise 1.1-2

Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a
real-world setting?

### Solution

Computational resource consumption (i.e., memory, disk usage), cost to
implement, ease of use, ease of explanation, simplicity.

### Exercise 1.1-3

Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its strengths
and limitations.

### Solution

A linked list. The linked list is useful to create arbitrarily-large sets of
data in a set order without immediately allocating resources for a "maximum"
size. However, the linked list can be improperly linked leading to searching
through an endless loop or risk accessing incorrect or dangerous data.

### Exercise 1.1-4

How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?

### Solution

Both problems involve path-finding and involve finding the least distance
travelled over a given set of coordinates. The difference is that the
traveling-salesman problem require return distance as its final coordinate point
rather than a one-way trip.

### Exercise 1.1-5

Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do. Then
come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good
enough.

### Solution

Eliminating pests. Getting rid of ninety-nine percent is not good enough if they
can breed back to full destructive capacity.

Harmonically analyzing a piece of Common Practice period music with figured bass
and Roman numerals. There may be multiple ways to interpret the given data, and
therefore an approximately-perfect solution is adequate.
